This repository demonstrates a bug in React Router Dom v6 related to catch-all routes. The issue occurs when a catch-all route (`/*`) is defined after more specific routes.  The catch-all route unexpectedly matches even when a more specific route should be selected.  The solution involves reordering routes or using a more specific catch-all route (e.g., `/notfound` instead of `/*`).
